My name is **[Samay Shamdasani](https://shamdasani.org)** and I built enlight. In 2015, I learned (& still am) to code the web. At first, I ended up taking many courses and reading books learning about the language. However, I learned so many terms, objects, statements, etc. that I couldn't really implement them. Then, I started to make mini-projects by following tutorials online and scraping through code on GitHub. Here's my attempt at sharing my knowledge of these mini-projects so that you can develop your skills by actually creating something. On here, you'll find a variety of fun, useful, and interesting projects related to my (and other contributor's) learning to code experience. I hope you'll benefit from them.
